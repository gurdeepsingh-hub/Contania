Tanant dashboad:
1. In navigation bar add settings field. -> on click of this we open setting page.
2. in setting page we have following options: Entity Settings, User Settings, Tenant Users, Personalization, User Roles.
3. Manage users option will be removed from navigation bar and tenant users option in setting will replace the manage users functionality.
4. I want Tenants to manage their own roles (dynamic roles). they can create new roles, manage permission for each role. refer to below written points.
    4a. there will be one admin role (have whole access to all tenat platform and this role will be fixed not deletable and non editable).
    4b. then there will be option to add new role and permissions given to that role ( can also be editable later ).
    4c. When a role is assigned to any tenant user . user can only access sections of dashboard which are given in their permissions all other sections are restricted.
    4d. all roles will be dynamically fetched in manage users tab and shown in dropdown while edit or create new user process.
